# Zfraction

Description :
    This project is written in C++ and is based on the learning book "Apprennez le langage c++". 
    The exercise was to create a class named "Zfraction" that could take 0, 1, or 2 arguments and react accordingly to create a fraction in the following form: "4/5".


    In addition, I had to create operator overloading methods to display the attributes of my class and perform arithmetic/logical operations between objects.


Skills Acquired :
    - Operator overloading
    - References
    - Classes (Attributes, methods, etc.)
    - Variable manipulation

Components :
    This project consists of 4 files:
        - Prog.exe (Executable file to run and see the results of my work)
        - main.cpp (File to visualize the results in code format)
        - Zfraction.cpp (File containing methods, functions, and operator overloading implementations)
        - Zfraction.h (Header file containing the class structure and operator overloading prototypes)

Creation Time : ~5 hours
